Sales Analytics â€“ Department Store

Problem Statement


We have a dataset of a simple department store which is spread across USA. The Owner of the department store wants a dashboard where he can track how well his department store is doing in terms of sales, Profit and Quantity of items Sold.

He also wants to know how well the categories of products are performing in different regions.

The Owner thinks that a lot of his customers buy 2 or more products per order but he wants it to be confirmed by the data.

He also noted that the profit is 30% of the selling price.
