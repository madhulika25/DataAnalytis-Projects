Problem Statement

The HR Director of a company has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff and provided you with the data.

She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).

She would also like to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.
